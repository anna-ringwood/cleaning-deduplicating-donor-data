# Wrangling Donor Data for a Georgia Nonprofit Organization

This project was carried out with the support of the [Quantitative Theory and Methods Department (QTM)](https://quantitative.emory.edu/) at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. A team of third- and fourth-year undergraduate QTM students, under the guidance of an industry mentor, worked to clean and derive insights from three data sets provided by the [Georgia Early Education Alliance for Ready Students (GEEARS)](https://geears.org/).
